        <p>
          UX design never comes to an end. Keep iterating and you'll find yet another performance enhancement.

        <p>
          Goals can be solid or vague, but you still have to outline what you want to test and achieve. If you have an eCommerce site, your goal may be to boost up the sales figure. For a non-governmental organisation, it may be more page views to raise awareness of certain issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the case to be demonstrated here, SnagR, as a B2B solution company, wants to increase the conversion rate of signing up.
        </p>

        <h2><span>DESIGNING </span><span>EXPERIMENTS</span></h2>
        <p>
          No matter what your goal is, you have to create testable hypotheses. I'm going to share an experiments I've run for SnagR's corporate website - Homepage design versus Sign-up rate. The <a href="https://snagr.co.uk/en/solution">original</a> and <a href="https://snagr.co.uk/en/">new</a> designs are attached below :-

          <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/data-informed-design/original-design.png">
          <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/data-informed-design/new-design.png">

      </div>

      <div class="section center">
        <h2><span>ANALYTICAL </span><span>TOOLS</span></h2>
        <p>
          So you've prepared for the tests, the next question is how to collect the data you need.
        </p>
        <p>
          There're a number of A/B testing tools in the market. Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager are free and simple to implement. If you have the budget and want to run more complicated tests with less effort (and more user-friendly interface), you may consider Optimizely or AB Tasty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heatmap is also very valuable to gain a full understanding of user behavior. Crazy Egg is great, while I've lately found a free tool called the SmartLock, but I haven't checked it out.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/data-informed-design/experiment.png">
        <p>
          For SnagR's experiment, the free Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager are already sufficient.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section center">
        <h2><span>VALIDATE & </span><span>MODIFY</span></h2>
        <p>
          What to do with the data? It's pretty straight-forward actually. Figure out if and when your design tests have reached statistical significance (Google Analytics is kind enough to do the math for you), and in most cases you can just dump the less-performant design and use the better one.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the new design has a higher conversion rate, I've replaced the original design with the winner.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section center">
        <h2><span>KEEP </span><span>ITERATING</span></h2>
        <p>
          There are a lot more to be tested for this B2B corporate website. As a matter of fact, another validated experiment I ran for SnagR was the <a href="signup-form.html">sign-up form redesign</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/signup-form/new-signup-form-1-mockup.png">
        <p>
          If you have an eCommerce site and possibly many more user sessions, you can run even more tests on lots of elements endlessly. Go crazy with copies, images, user flows, or asthetic attributes such as color palette and typography.
