        <h1>Logo Design for SnagR</h1>
        <p>
          SnagR is launching 2 more mobile apps so it's a great opportunity to redesign its branding and logo in one-go.

        <h2><span>PROJECT </span><span>BACKGROUND</span></h2>
        <p>
          If your brand has subrands, you have to decide if you'd like to emphasize on their relationship. If you prefer a cohesive branding strategy, you'll have to design a more versatile logo.
        </p>
        <p>
          SnagR, a B2B software company, had one and only SnagR app for construction professionals. Its previous company logo and app icon are attached below :-

        <p>
          SnagR is about to release two apps under the same brand, namely SnagR Home and SnagR Facility Management (SnagR FM). Therefore, it becomes the best opportunity to review on its brand as well as the logo and app icon designs.

      <div class="section center">
        <h2><span>THEME </span><span>DESIGN</span></h2>
        <p>
          In general, a good logo design should convey your brand image (a.k.a. voice of your company) and some idea of what your business is about. In addition, if you'd like to have the freedom to expand your brand with more apps, it's best to make your main theme flexible to adapt different verions as spin-offs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point to note is that, if you're redesigning a logo (versus designing from scratch), you should carefully retain some of the "old" brand elements in other to keep the brand consistent - especially when customers have already familiarised themselves with the brand. In SnagR's case, I've decided to retain the color blue and its capitalisation patterns "snagR", whilst the app icon will inherit the letter "R".
        </p>

        <p>
          SnagR is a cutting-edge, professional construction issue management software. It's value proposition emphaisizes on its location-based issue plotting feature. Therefore, the concept "location" has be incorporated in the design.

        <h2><span>SNAGR </span><span>HOME</span></h2>
        <p>
          SnagR Home will be used by home owners during the property handover period. We've incorporated a different color palette for the app. In contrast to SnagR Pro's dark theme for legibility in dimmed construction sites, SnagR Home adopts a brighter and more joyful color of orange. Its app icon has a house shape to represent HOME.

        <h2><span>SNAGR </span><span>FACILITY MANAGEMENT</span></h2>
        <p>
          SnagR FM's users will include facility managers, shopping mall tenants and the maintenance team. The app will serve as a communication platform mainly for tenants to report issues to facility managers and the maintenance team. Its color palette will be more like a salmon pink, and the icon has a bolt shape to represent repairing tools.

        <h2><span>APPS as its own </span><span>BRANDS</span></h2>
        <p>
          Have you picked up the consistent "R" in all the app icons? Those designs can also be incorporated into the SnagR company brand. It's useful for future marketing efforts, when the apps are being sold separately, while maintaining its strong brand advocacy of SnagR as a whole.
