        <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
        <p>
          A content strategy is the "why" to your business. Below, I'll cover how I developed the content strategy for a B2B software company.

        <p>
          SnagR is a B2B software company. There's only one main product for them to sell, namely the SnagR system. It's a construction project management software, which targets middle- to high-level management people in the industry.

        <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/content-strategy/construction.jpg">
        <p>
          It's very important to know your audience when constructing a content strategy. A guy in management level is very different from the guy on the construction site. Despite of the fact that the worker is your acutal user, when creating your content strategy, you're speaking to the decision maker. Be sure to convey the benefits of your product to the manager.

        <h2><span>COMPETITOR </span><span>ANALYSIS</span></h2>
        <p>
          There aren't many big players in the market of construction project management software, the largest being Procore and Aconex. But there are quite a handful of smaller players who may be new or old to this industry. Identify your competitors, and define your own value proposition against theirs. The starting point can be studying their corporate website.

          It's time to put yourself into your audience's shoes. Speak to your existing or potential clients. Make sure your know their industry, their current painpoints, what they'd like to archieve, their industry jargons, etc.
